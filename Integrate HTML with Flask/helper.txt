## what is the use of request method in the above code ? Give me detailed answer specific to the context

In the example code I provided, the request.method is used to check whether the route was accessed with a GET or POST request. This is important because we want to display the form on the page with a GET request, and process the form data with a POST request.
Here's a more detailed explanation of what's happening:
When a user accesses a website, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server. The HTTP request includes a method, which tells the server what kind of request it is. The two most common HTTP methods are GET and POST.
A GET request is used to retrieve data from the server. When a user enters a URL in their browser and hits enter, the browser sends a GET request to the server to retrieve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the webpage.
A POST request is used to submit data to the server. When a user fills out a form on a webpage and clicks the "submit" button, the browser sends a POST request to the server with the data from the form.
In our example code, we define a route for the root URL ('/') and specify that it accepts both GET and POST requests using the methods parameter in the @app.route decorator.
When the route is accessed with a GET request, the function returns the rendered HTML template containing the form. The request.method in this case will be 'GET'.
When the route is accessed with a POST request (i.e. when the form is submitted), the function extracts the data from the request using the request.form dictionary. The request.method in this case will be 'POST'.
By checking the value of request.method, we can determine what kind of request was made and take appropriate action. In this case, we use an if statement to check whether the request method is 'POST', and if it is, we extract the form data and perform some action with it (e.g. store it in a database or send an email).
So, to summarize, the request.method attribute in Flask is used to determine whether the current HTTP request is a GET or POST request. In our example code, we use it to distinguish between displaying the form (GET request) and processing the form data (POST request).
